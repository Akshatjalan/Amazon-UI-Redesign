<p align="center">🚀 Excited to share my latest project — a fresh Redesign for Amazon.in! 👨‍💻✨

🌟 As a passionate developer, I undertook the initiative to redesign Amazon's interface with the goal of enhancing user experience. This project focuses on creating a modern, intuitive, and user-friendly landing page, built using the **MERN stack** - `MongoDB`, `ExpressJS`, `ReactJS`, `NodeJS` alongside **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.

🎯 Stay tuned as I continue to expand this project by developing a complete website redesign with backend integration. <p>
